# Brax v0.0.16 Release Notes

This release adds a new module: `brax.experimental.tracing` that allows for domain randomization during training.  This release also adds support for placing replay buffers on device using `pjit` which allows for more configurable parallelism across many devices.  Finally this release includes a number of small bug fixes.

This will be the final release before we release a preview of a significant API change, so users may want to pin to this version if API stability is important.
