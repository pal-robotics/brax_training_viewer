# Brax v0.1.0 Release Notes

This minor release adds a preview of a major overhaul to Brax's API and

Brax's first stable (1.0) release.

The new features of Brax v2 include:

*   Generalized physics backend.
*   Continued support for the Spring physics backends. PBD will soon follow.
*   Direct support for Mujoco XML format, and URDF by association.
*   Fully traceable System object.
*   Env API that better supports custom physics backends.
*   Open sourced visualizer server.
