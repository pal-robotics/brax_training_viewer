# Brax v0.10.0 Release Notes

This minor release makes several changes to the brax API, such that [MJX](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html) data structures are the core data structures used in brax. This allows for more seamless model loading from `MuJoCo` XMLs, and allows for running `MJX` physics more seamlessly in brax.

* Rebase brax `System` and `State` onto `mjx.Model` and `mjx.Data`.
* Separate validation logic from the model loading logic in `brax.io.mjcf`. This allows users to load an [MJX](https://mujoco.readthedocs.io/en/stable/mjx.html) model in brax, without hitting validation errors for other physics backends like `positional` and `spring`.
* Remove `System.geoms`, since `brax.System` inherits from `mjx.Model` and all geom information is available in `mjx.Model`. We also update the brax viewer to work with this new schema.
* Delete the brax contact library and use the contact library from `MJX`.
* Use the MuJoCo renderer instead of pytinyrenderer for `brax.io.image`.
