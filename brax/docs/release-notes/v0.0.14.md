# Brax v0.0.14 Release Notes

This release includes a refactor of the training code to make it more modular and hackable, with each algorithm now as a separate submodule under `brax.training.agents`.

This release also updates references to the deprecated jax.tree* functions to their new home in jax.tree_util, fixes a few bugs in physics/collision code, and adds an initial implementation of box-box collisions.
