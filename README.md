# Brax Training Viewer for Real-Time Policy Visualization

This project is developed during the Google Summer of Code 2025.

Reinforcement Learning (RL) training in Brax operates at high performance, utilizing JAX for efficient parallelized training. However, due to the nature of JAX’s computation model, training occurs in a highly abstracted and batched manner, making it challenging to inspect agent behavior in real-time. Currently, users must either wait until training finishes to evaluate policies or extract rollout data manually, which is inefficient and restricts debugging capabilities. A Brax Training Viewer would empower users to visualize the evolution of the policy while training is ongoing, bridging the gap between RL research and practical interpretability.

The Brax Training Viewer offers an interactive, real-time visualization tool for monitoring reinforcement learning (RL) policies during training, utilizing the official PPO training function from Brax. This package allows users to synchronize the training with a MuJoCo-based viewer, showcasing the effect of the actions taken by the RL policy across numerous parallel environments. Users can benefit from real-time action updates, which enable them to track the evolution of the policy over time. A toggle option to enable or disable synchronization will be provided to enhance performance, allowing users to pause visualization and speed up the training process temporarily.

As this tool extends the official Brax PPO training function, it ensures seamless compatibility with current reinforcement learning pipelines. This allows for easy implementation without changing existing RL workflows, making it an excellent choice for researchers and practitioners needing to visualize, debug, and analyze RL policies in Brax with minimal configuration.

## Outcomes

* Synchronized MuJoCo Visualization with Brax Training – Extract actions generated by the policy network at each training step and apply them to a parallel running MuJoCo simulation
* Support Parallel Environments – The viewer will visualize multiple parallel agents, reflecting the exact training conditions in Brax.
* Allow Enable/Disable rendering – Since the copy process from GPU to CPU slows down the training process, users can dynamically enable or disable the data transfer to have high-speed training without visual feedback or keep visualization synchronized at the cost of slower training
